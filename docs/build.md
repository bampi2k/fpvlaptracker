# build instructions

the project uses gradle and gulp as build systems. theres a gradle task to execute gulp automatically.

## installation
install jdk, gradle and npm (node package manager).
issue a `npm install` command in the root project folder to install all node modules.

## build
run the gradle build task to build the project (`gradle build`). the build/libs folder contains the final jar file including everything needed to run.
